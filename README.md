[Crusader Kings II] [Playable, Unfinished Features] 
A small Mini-Mod for Crusader Kings II where a Horse invades Central Europe in a similar fashion to the Aztecs and Mongols. 
Requires Horse Lords if you want to play as the horse (VIA Console).

Currently unfinished, but its completly playable. 
I wanted to add a few variants to the Horse so its not always Slepinir, make its religion dynamic so its not always Catholic, 
and allow it to spawn in more places than a few very specific provinces. 

USAGE: 
If anyone wishes to finish my work, shoot me a message here or on steam and please credit me in the mod and as a creator of the mod. :)
